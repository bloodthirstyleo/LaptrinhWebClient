    <p>One particular book which is recommended <br>
    reading is <u>The Street Lawyer</u> by John Grisham. <br>
    This book is about a lawyer who begins re- <br>
    evaluating his priorities in life when a bad <br>
    incident occours within his law firm. Consequently, <br>
    he becomes acquainted with the inner city streets, <br>
    and realizes the harsh existence of the homeless, <br>
    and vows to give them a chance in the courts. <u>The <br>
        Street Lawyer</u> is a great book. It is well written <br>
    and intersting. Other books by John Grisham <br>
    include <u>The Firm</u>. <u>The Penlican Brief</u>. and <u>The <br>
        Client.</u>

        I gazed down into valleys,<br>

        Then soared above the puffy clouds- <br>
        Too bad it was a dream!
